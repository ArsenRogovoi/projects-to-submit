I tried to make web messanger. He isn't completly built but there are several
things working. You can open two tabs with this project using live server extension (or sth else)
and log in with two different existing profiles and to see chat working. I haven't enough time
for this project because of required tasks and I want to submit all of this as fast as possible
for being more concentrated on learning React framework.
